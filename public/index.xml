      <description>Straightforward and Elegant ideas to conduct war The art of war is a military treatise written by almost a mythical figure from ancient China in the Spring and Autumn period (around 700-450 BCE) of ancient China. In it, Sun tzu breaks down the politics of war and its importance to thenation state. It is a short and easy read that I highly recommend to everyone. It took me 30 minutes to finish reading everything.</description>

      <description>This is officially my &amp;ldquo;Can you hear me now ?&amp;quot; moment. Took me quite a while to figure out the nooks and cranny of setting up a web page to record down my engineering journey page using Hugo.
I am almost done with my University / College education. I am just waiting for graduation ceremony now having completed all my courses and tests. In the mean time, I am embarking on a journey of life long self-learning.</description>
