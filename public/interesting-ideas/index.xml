      <description>Straightforward and Elegant ideas to conduct war The art of war is a military treatise written by almost a mythical figure from ancient China in the Spring and Autumn period (around 700-450 BCE) of ancient China. In it, Sun tzu breaks down the politics of war and its importance to thenation state. It is a short and easy read that I highly recommend to everyone. It took me 30 minutes to finish reading everything.</description>
