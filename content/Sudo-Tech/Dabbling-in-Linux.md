## The Linux experience

I have been using and learning about Linux for several months now. It is an amazing Operating System(OS) despite some of its flaws when compared to regular OS’s such as Windows and MACs for daily and uses. Using Linux is similar to pledging about  “learning and tinkering”.  I am referring to the fact that there is so much to discover in Linux it's like jumping into a bottomless rabbit hole but well worth it.

Installing linux in itself might be quite a project especially for those who are unfamiliar with it. There are multiple ways and different linux distribution that one can install. Personally I would recommend Linux mint, then Ubuntu if it doesn't work. Linux mint is beginner friendly, clean and easy to use distribution good to get your feet wet.                                                                                                                                      
## Mint, Kubuntu and Arch

So far, I managed to install 3 operating systems into my main laptop (Linux Mint) and secondary work laptop (Kubuntu and Arch). Using them has been quite a treat, with its endless customization and software options. More importantly, though, I have been using them to learn more about programming (C/C++) and to get familiar with the command line terminal. Ubuntu linux is also widely used as the Operating system of Choice for Robotic Operating System (ROS) so I planned to use Kubuntu for my future ROS-based projects.

## Everything is either a file or a process

This is quite literally the philosophy of the Linux operating system. Everything is either a file or a process, down to even the devices connected to the system itself. This is a powerful paradigm that helps us to understand our machines and operating system better. It definitely helped me when I was exploring and dabbling more into the linux world. Below i have compiled some useful links that helped me in my Linux journey (pun intended).
