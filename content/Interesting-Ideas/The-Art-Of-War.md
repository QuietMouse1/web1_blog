## Straightforward and Elegant ideas to conduct war 

The art of war is a military treatise written by almost a mythical figure from ancient China in the Spring and Autumn period (around 700-450 BCE) of ancient China. In it, Sun tzu breaks down the politics of war and its importance to thenation state. It is a short and easy read that I highly recommend to everyone. It took me 30 minutes to finish reading everything. While the book itself mainly discusses the strategems and concepts to apply in times of war, these same strategems could easily be applied anywhere such as business or life in general. This is the nature of the advice that Sun tzu gives in the militray treatise - Straightforward and Elegant. In this post, I am going to cover 3 key wisdoms to take home and ponder on.

## The art of war is of vital importance to the State.

This is the opening statement of the book it establishes the importance of understanding, grasping and excelling in military affairs for the state to survive. When we are doing work or anything in general, it is crucial we identify ideas, elements and concepts that could propel the work to excellence. Similarly, in our lives, I believe there is a need to understand what lifetyle and ideas that we are going to subscribe to in order to live a life that one wants or envisions to be. ie, A good scientist believes in rationalistic thinking and the scientific method.

## All Warfare Is Based on Deception.

Deception is another theme that is prevalent in the book where deceiving your enemy and controlling their beliefs would easily gain you an edge in the battle field. While I do not condone and practice deceiving others to gain an edge, *unless necessary*, it is critical that we are able to identify such deception as we will encounter them frequently throughout our lives. ie, Am i being short changed in this bargain?Is he decieving others about his lifestyle? etc. 

## Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.

It is self-explanatory and share similar sentiments to "work smarter, not harder". Excellence and mastery according to Sun tzu is through the display of optimal and yet minimal to achieve a set of outcomes. Of course this does mean that being hardworking is a negative trait, rather we should be more wary and intelligent when setting out to achieve our desired goals and outcomes.
