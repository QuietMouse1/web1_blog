## Straightforward and Elegant ideas to conduct war 

The art of war is a military treatise written by almost a mythical figure from ancient China in the Spring and Autumn period (around 700-450 BCE) of ancient China. In it, Sun Tzu breaks down the politics of war and its importance to the nation-state. It is a short and easy read that I highly recommend to everyone. It took me 30 minutes to finish reading everything. While the book itself mainly discusses the strategies and concepts to apply in times of war, these same strategies could easily be applied anywhere such as business or life in general. This is the nature of the advice that Sun Tzu gives in the military treatise - Straightforward and Elegant. In this post, I am going to cover 3 key pearls of wisdom to take home and ponder on.

## The art of war is of vital importance to the State.

The opening statement of the book establishes the importance of understanding and excelling in military affairs for the state to survive. When we are doing work or anything in general, we must identify ideas, elements, and concepts that could propel our work to excellence. Similarly, in our lives, I believe there is a need to understand what lifestyle and ideas that we are going to subscribe to for us to live a life that one wants or envisions to be. ie, A good scientist believes in rationalistic thinking and the scientific method.

## All Warfare Is Based on Deception.

Deception is another theme that is prevalent in the book where deceiving your enemy and controlling their beliefs would easily gain you an edge on the battlefield. While I do not condone and practice deceiving others *unless necessary*, it is critical that we can identify such deception as we will encounter them frequently throughout our lives. ie, Am I being short-changed in this bargain? etc. 

## Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.

This self-explanatory and shares similar sentiments to "work smarter, not harder". Excellence and mastery according to Sun Tzu are through the display of optimal and yet minimal to achieve a set of outcomes. Of course, this does mean that being hardworking is a negative trait, rather we should be more wary and intelligent when setting out to achieve our desired goals and outcomes.
